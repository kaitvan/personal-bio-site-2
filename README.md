# Personal Bio Site 2.0
This site provides examples of my work in addition to a description of my work experience and areas of interest. 
* The homepage serves as a portfolio with cards including a screenshot of the webpage, a live link to the page, and a link to the GitHub repo. 
* The footer contains contact information and a brief description of the technologies I use in my projects. 
* This 2.0 version took my personal bio site to the next level, using webpack configuration and ES6 modules.
